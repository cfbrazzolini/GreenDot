		  <h3> What is Green Dot? </h3>
		  <p> Whitworth Green Dot acts on the belief that we are called to care for each other.
The Green Dot movement is about gaining a critical mass of students, staff and faculty who are willing and equipped 
to do their small part to reduce power-based personal violence and make our world a safer place for everyone. A Green Dot is any behavior,
choice or action that promotes safety for everyone and sets the cultural norm that violence of any kind is not acceptable.
<b>Ending violence. One Green Dot at a Time! </b></p>
